# Work Day Scheduler

Our objective was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br/>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br/>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br/>
WHEN I open the planner<br/>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br/>
WHEN I scroll down<br/>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br/>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br/>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br/>
WHEN I click into a time block<br/>
THEN I can enter an event<br/>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br/>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br/>
WHEN I refresh the page<br/>
THEN the saved events persist<br/>
